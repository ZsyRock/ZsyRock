## Some one is going to draw a low pixel 'LEARNING' on the contributions graph ðŸ˜†
### The one almost done with the first 'L', the one will not make any updates to GitHub on the following dates: 
### 9th Feb (Fri) [and so forth](https://github.com/ZsyRock/ZsyRock/blob/main/LEARNING%20Calendar.png)
### If the one has not updated his GitHub in these days, it does not mean that he is not learning, he is just addicted to the game.
### Will be as the IT Analyst at Huawei Monich Research Center (2012 Lab) from March 2024. Currently learning Data Mining, ML and algorithms.
