### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### Some one is going to draw a low pixel 'LEARNING' on the 2024 calendar ðŸ˜†
### The one will start from the first letter 'L', which means that he will not make any updates to GitHub on the following dates:
### 15th~19th Jan (Mon to Fri), 
### 26th Jan, 
### 2nd Feb,
### 9th Feb,
### ...
### If the one has not updated his GitHub in these days, it does not mean that he is not learning, he is just addicted to the game.
